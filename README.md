- **Case 3:** Suspicious Narration ("TRF", "TRANSFER", "CASH", "SELF")
- **Case 1.5:** Combined High-Value Overview (Deposits + Withdrawals)
- **🟣 Overlap Analysis:** Venn diagram showing cross-flagged transactions

## 📊 Visuals

- Pie & bar charts for narration breakdown
- Line graph showing duplicate trends over months
- Venn diagram for Case 1, 2 & 3 overlaps
